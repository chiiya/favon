### Commands

These are all the console commands used by the Media module of Favon, divided into commands used to initialize the application state (`Initialize`) and tasks that get executed regularly (`Cronjobs`). On top of that, there are a few utility commands:

`favon:imdb:scrape {url}` - Scrapes the IMDB ids from any IMDB list. Could be useful for importing watchlists from users for example.
